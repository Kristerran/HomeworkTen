## Description
-This project will allow users to stay more organized with a dynamic note taking application. The program will allow users to store notes, view notes, and write new notes al from the application. (delete notes upcoming!)

### Project Motivation:
- I have always wanted to create a notes application, I love the simplicity and usefullness of them. This project has allowed me to learn the ins and outs of storing data and using express to create routes. I plan to create my own unique notes application later in the course. I also plan to use these skills in my current personal projects involving storing and retreaving image files.

### Project Problem solved:
- This project allows for better time management and memory issues (A personal importance to me) A simple app such as this allows you to store any information without too much clutter or unneeded functionality getting in the way

### Skills Learned during project:
- This project has solidified the knowlage of express routing, and JSON Storage/retreval
